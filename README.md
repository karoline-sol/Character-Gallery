Character Gallery

This project is a simple JavaScript application that allows users to create and display character cards. Each card contains a name, type, description, and image. The data is stored in localStorage, so characters remain visible even after refreshing the page.


Features:
Add a character by filling out a form with:
- Type
- Name
- Description
- Image URL

Characters are saved in localStorage. A gallery view dynamically displays character cards with their image and description. The form then clears automatically after adding a character. When the character card is clicked, it navigates to the character detail page where a list of items can be added to the character's bag. 

How it Works:
1. Enter character details into the form.
2. Click the Add Character button.
3. The character card is created and added to the gallery.
4. Cards persist on page reload using localStorage.
5. Click card.
6. Select item name and type. 
7. Click Add item to create list. 

Technologies Used:
HTML for structure
CSS for basic styling
JavaScript for functionality and DOM manipulation
